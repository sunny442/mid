		    <div class="info__one">
			    <div class="wrap">
			        <h4>Clear and direct approach</h4>
		            <p>The book is written with the shortest possible amount of text content. It aimed for visual learners.</p>
		        </div>
			    <div class="wrap">
		         	<h4>140+ Custom illustrations</h4>
			        <p>I tried to include an illustration to each example in the book. A picture is worth a thousand words.</p>
		       </div>
		      <div class="wrap">
			        <h4>The only book about debugging CSS</h4>
		            <p>No one ever wrote an article or a detailed guide about such a topic. What if there is a book about it?</p>
		        </div>
		    </div>
	
		    <div class="info__two">
		    	
		    	
			    <div class="column">
		    	    <h4>Real-life examples</h4>
			        <p>All the examples in the book are things that you face in your day to day work. Nothing is abstract.</p>

		        <div class="column">
			        <h4>Made by a designer-turned developer</h4>

			    <p class="chatbox">CSS is sadly an increasingly undervalued tool for front end developers, in no small part because developers find debugging CSS challenging. Yet, until now there's been little in depth published on debugging CSS. Ahmad Shadeed's book is long overdue, and I can't recommend it highly enough for any front end developer.</p>
